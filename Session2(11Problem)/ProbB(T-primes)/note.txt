Explain of the case:
this case is the t-prime where the each number have the divisors, and we count the total number of that divisors and the total is prime number or not, if yes,
the output will be yes


How to solve it?
there's have 2 ways to solve it:
1. U can find how many divisors are the numbers have (this method not optimal and got memory limit) -> on Vjudge and got time limit in codeforces
2. I solve with pre compute sieve, and using rules to find the tprimes  
    U can find t primes by 3 rules:
    a. Calculate the square root: The square root of 999966000289 is approximately 999983.000289.

    b. Check if it's an integer: The square root is not an integer; it has a fractional part.

    c. Check for three distinct divisors: To be Ð¢-prime, a number must have exactly three distinct positive divisors.
        1. One divisor is 1.
        2. The number itself (999966000289) is another divisor.
        3. The third divisor must be a prime number.
